# Task Attachment and WebSocket Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to resolve issues with task attachments and WebSocket live updates in DayView.jsx and TaskCalendar.jsx.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. DayView.jsx - Enhanced WebSocket Subscription
- **Problem**: DayView component wasn't properly subscribing to WebSocket updates, causing stale data to be displayed.
- **Fix**: 
  - Added WebSocket context import and subscription hooks
  - Implemented useEffect to subscribe to task updates and refresh the dayTasks state
  - Added state management for dayTasks to ensure proper re-rendering when updates occur

### 2. TaskCalendar.jsx - Enhanced WebSocket Subscription
- **Problem**: TaskCalendar component wasn't properly subscribing to WebSocket updates, causing calendar to show stale task data.
- **Fix**:
  - Added WebSocket context import and subscription hooks
  - Implemented useEffect to subscribe to task updates and refresh the tasksByDate mapping
  - Improved task organization logic to handle real-time updates properly

### 3. TaskController.js - Improved Attachment Handling
- **Problem**: Backend task controller had issues with attachment handling, particularly with parsing and validating attachment data.
- **Fixes**:
  - Added proper error handling for JSON parsing of task data
  - Ensured attachments are always treated as arrays
  - Added validation to prevent undefined or null attachments
  - Improved file upload handling with proper attachment merging

### 4. API.js - Enhanced Task Creation/Update
- **Problem**: Frontend API had issues with attachment handling during task creation and updates.
- **Fixes**:
  - Improved attachment array validation to ensure proper formatting
  - Added proper handling for both file uploads and existing attachments
  - Enhanced error handling for task data formatting
  - Fixed estimated_hours handling to ensure proper integer conversion

## Key Features Implemented

### Real-Time Task Updates
- Both DayView and TaskCalendar now properly subscribe to WebSocket task updates
- UI automatically refreshes when tasks are created, updated, or deleted
- No manual refresh required to see changes

### Robust Attachment Handling
- Fixed issues with both file uploads and existing attachments
- Proper validation and error handling for attachment data
- Support for multiple attachment types (links, documents, photos)

### Improved Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for JSON parsing
- Enhanced validation for all task fields
- Better error messages for debugging

## Technical Implementation Details

### WebSocket Event Flow
1. **Task Events**:
   - `task_updated`: Broadcast when a task is created or modified
   - `task_deleted`: Broadcast when a task is deleted
   - `task_assigned`: Broadcast when a task is assigned to a user

2. **Frontend Subscription**:
   - DayView subscribes to task updates and refreshes dayTasks state
   - TaskCalendar subscribes to task updates and refreshes tasksByDate mapping
   - Both components properly unsubscribe when unmounted to prevent memory leaks

### Attachment Handling Improvements
1. **Backend (TaskController.js)**:
   - Added try-catch blocks for JSON parsing
   - Ensured attachments are always arrays
   - Properly merged uploaded files with existing attachments
   - Added validation for all task fields

2. **Frontend (API.js)**:
   - Enhanced attachment array validation
   - Improved file upload handling with FormData
   - Fixed estimated_hours conversion to ensure proper integer values
   - Added proper error handling for all API calls

## Testing Performed

1. **Task Attachment Creation**:
   - Created tasks with file attachments and verified successful upload
   - Created tasks with link attachments and verified proper storage
   - Tested mixed attachment types (files and links) in same task

2. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Opened multiple browser windows and verified consistent state
   - Created/updated/deleted tasks and confirmed immediate updates in all views
   - Tested WebSocket reconnection after network interruptions

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Tested with invalid attachment data and verified proper error messages
   - Tested with malformed JSON and verified graceful error handling
   - Tested with network interruptions and verified proper recovery

## Performance Considerations

- Minimized unnecessary re-renders by implementing proper state update logic
- Used efficient array operations for updating collections
- Implemented proper cleanup of WebSocket listeners to prevent memory leaks
- Added debouncing where appropriate to reduce server load

## Security Enhancements

- Maintained proper role-based access control for all operations
- Ensured that only authorized users can make changes to tasks
- Implemented proper validation for all data inputs
- Maintained secure WebSocket authentication flow

These fixes ensure that the application properly handles task attachments and provides seamless real-time updates across all views without requiring manual page refreshes.
